# Northstar Digital Agency — Claude instructions

## YouTube: always use the youtube-channel-automation skill (own Google Cloud client)

For any YouTube channel task (uploading, scheduling, editing titles/descriptions/tags/privacy/
publish time, thumbnails, playlists, reading and replying to comments, auto comment replies in
scheduled tasks, checking status), use `.claude/skills/youtube-channel-automation/SKILL.md`.
- Call the YouTube API directly with the agency's Google Cloud OAuth client
  (`YT_CLIENT_ID` / `YT_CLIENT_SECRET` / `YT_REFRESH_TOKEN`, project `168994544641`).
- **Do not use Clawlink or Metricool for YouTube anymore**, in chat or in scheduled tasks,
  not even as a fallback. If the API fails or the quota is used up, say so and stop.
- Confirm the title, description, publish time, and video file with the user before uploading.
- Never delete a video, comment or playlist unless the user explicitly asks for that deletion.
- Log uploads/schedules/edits in `social/youtube-schedule-log.md` and comment replies in
  `social/youtube-comments-log.md`, then commit and push.

## YouTube analysis: use vidIQ

For any YouTube analysis (channel or video performance, keyword and topic research, competitor
channels, titles, tags, best posting times, outlier videos), use the **vidIQ** connector first.
- Fall back to the YouTube Analytics API through the youtube-channel-automation skill
  (`yt.py analytics`) only when vidIQ is not connected or has no tool for the question.
  Do not use Clawlink or Metricool analytics. Say which source was used.
- If vidIQ is not connected, tell the user it needs to be authorized in claude.ai connector
  settings before using the fallback.

## Facebook Page: always use the facebook-page-automation skill

For any NorthStar Dizital Facebook Page task (uploading videos/Reels, posting, scheduling,
deleting, timed takedowns, checking status), use `.claude/skills/facebook-page-automation/SKILL.md`.
- Call the Graph API directly (`graph.facebook.com` / `graph-video.facebook.com`, credential
  injected by the proxy). Do not use Clawlink or Metricool for the Facebook Page.
- Never delete an uploaded video or post unless the user explicitly asks for that deletion.
- Log every action in `social/facebook-page-log.md`, then commit and push.
