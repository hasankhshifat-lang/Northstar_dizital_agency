# Learning database: Scientific Bithi / সাইন্টিফিক বিথী (Facebook Page 1497857623404891)

Audience: Bangladeshi audience, Bangla comic science (NCTB classes 6–10). **Only this channel's lessons go here; never mix them with the other channel.**
Rules: `docs/content/animation-direction-rules.md` section 8. Read this file before making a new video.

How to write to it: this file lives on `main`. A task working on another branch reads it with
`git show origin/main:social/learning/scientific-bithi.md` and adds rows on main through a separate worktree:
`git fetch origin main && git worktree add -f /tmp/ns-main origin/main && cd /tmp/ns-main && git checkout -B main origin/main`,
edit this file only, commit, `git push origin main` (if rejected: `git pull --rebase origin main` and push again;
network errors: retry with backoff 2s/4s/8s/16s), then `cd -` and `git worktree remove --force /tmp/ns-main`.
Metrics are filled in later (analytics lag 2–3 days); write "n/a" for a metric the platform doesn't give, never a guess.

## Proven practices (evidence-backed; updated by the weekly review)

_None yet. Add a line only with the videos/metrics that support it._

## Experiments

| Tag | Variable changed (one only) | Variants | Videos so far | Status | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Weekly reviews

_Newest first: date, best/weakest video, patterns, comment themes, decisions._

- 2026-11-14 (daily run note, not a full weekly review): first real retention data (FB video_insights now readable). All three posted Shorts lose 30–50% of viewers between 3 s and 6 s, and average watch time is 3–8 s of ~60 s. Samples are tiny (11–192 plays, 1 follower), so no conclusions yet; the first priority to watch is the first 3–6 s.
